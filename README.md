# Movie_Recommendation_System
 A movie recommendation system based on cosine similarity is a project aimed at providing personalized movie suggestions to users. In this system, movies are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space based on their content features, such as genre, actors, directors, plot keywords, and so on. Cosine similarity is then used as a measure to determine the similarity between these vectors.
#Imp points :-
Cosine Similarity Calculation: Calculate the cosine similarity between the feature vectors of all pairs of movies in the dataset. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors and provides a measure of similarity between them. Higher cosine similarity values indicate greater similarity.
User Profile Creation: When a user interacts with the system, their preferences are captured either explicitly (e.g., through ratings) or implicitly (e.g., through their viewing history). This information is used to create a user profile, represented as a vector in the same feature space as the movies.
